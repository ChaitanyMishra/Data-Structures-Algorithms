# 📚 DSA Preparation for Interviews

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** journey! 🚀
This repository contains my solutions to various DSA problems, organized topic-wise and language-wise. The goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare for technical interviews at product-based companies.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build a strong foundation in **Data Structures & Algorithms**
* Practice and optimize solutions for **coding interviews**
* Track progress across **LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and Codeforces**
* Improve problem-solving speed and code quality
